# Build Instructions

The first paragraph tells the company why you want to work for them. Once you
have written down why you want to work there, back it up with a single specific
reason why.

The second paragraph tells the company why they want to hire you. Highlight the
exact things you want to bring to the company, whether itâ€™s knowledge of some
tech, domain knowledge, a process you follow, or whatever else you think might
work to help solve their problems. And again, back it up with a specific
example.

A great cover letter is an opportunity to explain any shortcomings you might
have. Horribly underqualified but pretty sure you have what it takes? Have a
huge gap in your resume? Really, really want to work for this particular
company? The cover letter is where you do it.

# Past CV

What happened to oDesk? Well, at least I've been carried over to UpWork!  But
that means I'm not a "Rising Talent" and don't have a "Responsiveness" or
"Job Success" scores. Hopefully we can change that because after recovering from
 back surgery and being full-time dad for a while, I am back and ready to code!

I've been programming in some form or another since the mid 90's and have
studied a wide variety of languages and computer science topics. I'm primarily
drawn to the web platform these days and have experience building everything
from REST APIs, content management systems, single page apps, and games.



I might just be the front-end bug hunter you need, but I haven't been active on
UpWork for quite a while. I have a diverse portfolio in my profile and more info
can be found on my personal site: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/
or my GitHub profile: https://github.com/chpmnrssll

Hope to hear from you, but if not;
Thanks for reading,
  Russ
