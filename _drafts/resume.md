OBJECTIVE
I have studied a wide variety of programming languages ranging from x86 assembly to javascript and most everything in between. Having been involved with the internet, web development, and programming off and on from the mid 90's, I've dabbled in everything from REST APIs to complex single page apps, games, and more. Currently doing both client & server side development and am always interested in learning latest standards and best practices.
