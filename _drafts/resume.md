OBJECTIVE
I have studied a wide variety of programming languages ranging from x86 assembly
 to javascript and most everything in between. Having been involved with the
 internet, web development, and programming off and on from the mid 90's, I've
 dabbled in everything from REST APIs to complex single page apps, games, and
 more. Currently doing both client & server side development and am always
 interested in learning latest standards and best practices.
