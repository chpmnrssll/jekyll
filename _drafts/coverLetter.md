# Build Instructions

The first paragraph tells the company why you want to work for them. Once you
have written down why you want to work there, back it up with a single specific
reason why.

The second paragraph tells the company why they want to hire you. Highlight the
exact things you want to bring to the company, whether itâ€™s knowledge of some
tech, domain knowledge, a process you follow, or whatever else you think might
work to help solve their problems. And again, back it up with a specific
example.

A great cover letter is an opportunity to explain any shortcomings you might
have. Horribly underqualified but pretty sure you have what it takes? Have a
huge gap in your resume? Really, really want to work for this particular
company? The cover letter is where you do it.

Based on real Hired interview data, Frontend Engineers in Denver earn an average
annual salary of $110,014. The salaries of candidates in this role range from a
low of $60,000 to a high of $198,000, with a median salary of $110,000.

# Past CV

What happened to oDesk? Well, at least I've been carried over to UpWork!  But
that means I'm not a "Rising Talent" and don't have a "Responsiveness" or
"Job Success" scores. Hopefully we can change that because after recovering from
 back surgery and being full-time dad for a while, I am back and ready to code!

I've been programming in some form or another since the early 90's and have
studied a wide variety of languages and computer science topics. I'm primarily
drawn to the web platform these days and have experience building everything
from REST APIs, content management systems, single page apps, and games.


I might just be the front-end bug hunter you need, but I haven't been active on
UpWork for quite a while. I have a diverse portfolio in my profile and more info
can be found on my personal site: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/
or my GitHub profile: https://github.com/chpmnrssll


I haven't been active on Upwork for quite a while, but this sounds like an
interesting project to start back up with. I actually came across that link a
while back and read up on pseudo 3D type engines. Here's some other useful code
I found too: https://github.com/1kevinxu1/Sunset-Drive

If you still need help with this, I'm available and have experience with HTML5,
Javascript, & Canvas. I've done some Flash to HTML5 conversions too.

This looks like an interesting product, and I think I could be of help with the
frontend development. I'm located in eastern Colorado not far from you, if
that's worth anything.

I can tick all the boxes too:
HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, ES6, Ajax, Rest, APIs
Several client & server frameworks (And the underlying concepts)
Photoshop, Gimp, Inkscape
PHP, Ruby, Node
Git, Github
more...

I've built content management systems from scratch before, with and without MVC
frameworks, with SQL and MongoDB. I'm sure I can help you build some great UI &
components for controlling your CMS. Hope to hear from you!

I haven't been active on upWork/oDesk for quite a while, but this sounds like
just the thing to start back up with, so "Let's Design!". I have experience in
all of your requirements: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Wordpress, & can
be flexible with my rate. I'm more concerned with becoming an active developer again.

I've built everything from content management systems to Wordpress plug-ins in
the past. More info about me can be found on my upWork portfolio,
my personal site: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/
or GitHub: https://github.com/chpmnrssll

If you still need help, I'm sure I can help you build some great UI for your site.

This looks like a quick simple project. I think I could put it together for you
pretty quick. Slice up the PSD, add a bit of CSS and maybe some JavaScript. Do
you have the videos to be playing?

This looks like a quick simple project. I think I could put it together for you
fairly fast. I noticed you're in Woodland Park, I'm located just east of Colorado Springs,
if that make any difference.

I have experience in everything you need: JavaScript, PHP, Sass, Bootstrap, Git, & more.

I have experience in everything you need: JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, Sass, Bootstrap, Git, & more.

I am based in eastern Colorado (Mountain timezone -1), but can be available when I'm needed.


I think I may be able to help with the glitches and updates to your WordPress plugin.
I've built everything from content management systems to WordPress plugins in the
past and have experience with the WordPress plugin API.

Here's a live link to the last WP project I worked on: http://mscra.com/attorneys/mcra-public-directory/
It has a public member directory, admin dashboard controls, per user custom settings, etc..
More info & screens here: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/posts/about/MCRA

If you still need help, I could update that Jekyll theme with Font Awesome v5
right quick! I haven't been active on oDesk/upWork for quite a while, but this
sounds like a really simple project to start back up with.

I haven't been active on oDesk/upWork for quite a while though due to some medical
issues (my spinal fusion & my daughters scoliosis corrective surgeries), but am
now ready to dive back in. Becoming an active developer again is a higher
priority than my rate right now, so I can be flexible with that as well.

More info about me can be found on my upWork profile, Github: https://github.com/chpmnrssll/
or my site: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/

Check my chpmnrssll.github.io repo on Github, it has all my latest code as a sample (lots of vanilla ES6).

I think I might be of some help. I've built everything from content management
systems to WordPress plug-ins in the past, have experience in most of your
requirements, and am not afraid to pickup more frameworks as needed.

I'm in Simla, not far from Castle Rock if that makes any difference.
I haven't been active on oDesk/upWork for quite a while though due to some

I'm interested. I've built content management systems from scratch (with and without
frameworks) in PHP, Node, & Ruby. I haven't been active on oDesk/upWork for quite a
while though due to some medical issues (spinal fusion & my daughters scoliosis surgery),
but am now ready to dive back in. Becoming an active developer again is my highest
priority right now, so I can be as flexible as needed.


Absolutely, I'm very interested. I love working with graphics and math. Some questions though:
Do you have a plan/roadmap on how to use all the libraries together, or is the test to see how I would put all the pieces together?
Is this just the two components (regression plot & interactive table)?
What kind of data? It looks like Turf.js works with GeoJSON.
Does the rest of the app use the same stack?


I think I might be of help. I've built everything from content management systems
to WordPress plug-ins in the past, and have experience in everything you're looking
for. I've worked on the front and back end on a few WordPress sites, Joomla, and
even pure PHP+SQL. I'm not afraid to bring in other frameworks as they're needed.

I haven't been active on oDesk/upWork for quite a while due to some medical issues
(spinal fusion & my daughters' scoliosis surgery), but now it's time to get back
to it. Becoming an active developer again is my highest priority, so I can be as
flexible as you need.

My project site: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/
It's built with Ruby/Jekyll static site generator and hosted on Github Pages.
Includes lots of front-end polish (vanilla ES6, Sass, canvas, etc..).

Github: https://github.com/chpmnrssll/

My upWork profile has a few nice pieces as well.

All-right, here's the github repo for you to clone: https://github.com/chpmnrssll/identity-jekyll-theme
It fought me a little bit, but I usually always win in the end. Glad I could be
of help. I've been working with Jekyll for a while now so I know all the quirks.
Let me know if you need any more help.

Thanks,
Russ

## Past Q/A
How comfortable are you working in a Wordpress Environment? And creating custom post types, plugins, themes, etc.?
 I've worked on the front and back end on a few WP sites and developed an admin membership plugin. I've also worked with other content management systems like Joomla and even pure object oriented PHP+SQL. It's been a little while since I've done WP stuff, but I still know where to find the docs!

How comfortable are you using Github?
 I am fluent with Git & Github. There are a few repos with example code there and my personal site, which is built on Github Pages & Jekyll with a bunch of front-end polish on top.

How comfortable are you using Greensock (GSAP)?
 I haven't used GSAP api yet, but I'm no stranger to graphics and animation (see the Demos sections on my site). I actually looked into it for SVG manipulation but always end up doing vanilla JS things.

Are you on a Mac? What is your local WP working environment?
 No, I am running Arch linux with Gnome desktop. I have a LAMP stack dev enviroment setup with PHP, MariaDB (SQL), and a clean WP install.

Do you have experience in developing single-page web apps?
  Yes, single and multi-page apps. My personal dev site has been my playground
  for playing with SPA/PWA. It's built with Jekyll/Ruby, hosted on Github Pages,
   and has tons of newer frontend features.
  https://chpmnrssll.github.io/


Do you have experience working with Docker?
  I've used the RedHat OpenShift PaaS a bit, which is just another layer of
  abstraction on top of Docker containers and Kubernetes for deployment.


What is the hardest technical problem you've personally had to solve and what KPIs did that project affect?
  While not related to any KPI, I have spent the past year learning the in/outs
  of Arch linux and installing it on every piece of hardware that it will run on.
  Arch's "build it yourself" attitude to everything seems like a programmers
  playground, and it has some of the best docs around!


How many years experience do you have with CSS?
  15+, I've been using CSS since tables were used for page layout and flash was
  still cool.


How many years experience do you have with JavaScript?
  Since IE6 or so (early 2000s?). I remember Microsoft JScript nonsense.


Have you created responsive web applications before?
  Yes, my GitHub Pages site is a responsive single page app. It's built with
  Jekyll, Sass, BEM, CSS3, offline caching, animations, and lots of vanilla
  JavaScript.

  https://chpmnrssll.github.io/


Can you show me examples(links) of your best work? Which part of the project did
you directly contribute to? No Word Press or TEMPLATE SITES.
  My current portfolio site is some of my best work. It's a GitHub, Jekyll, Sass,
  BEM, single page, animated, offline, responsive app.
    https://chpmnrssll.github.io/

  Multi-user content management app:
    https://github.com/chpmnrssll/multi-CMS

  PHP MongoDB REST server:
    https://github.com/chpmnrssll/api

  Old PHP SQL content management system:
    https://github.com/chpmnrssll/old/tree/master/php


This project is very large with several custom features. Can you send me
examples of a website with custom software solutions that you like and why?


Are you comfortable working in someone else's code?
  Yes, as long as it's a consistent style; I am proficient with git too.
