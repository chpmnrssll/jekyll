## Build Instructions

The first paragraph tells the company why you want to work for them. Once you
have written down why you want to work there, back it up with a single specific
reason why.

The second paragraph tells the company why they want to hire you. Highlight the
exact things you want to bring to the company, whether it’s knowledge of some
tech, domain knowledge, a process you follow, or whatever else you think might
work to help solve their problems. And again, back it up with a specific example.

A great cover letter is an opportunity to explain any shortcomings you might have.
Horribly under-qualified but pretty sure you have what it takes? Have a huge gap
in your resume? Really, really want to work for this particular company?
The cover letter is where you do it.

## Profile

I'm usually available around 12-8am UTC, but can be flexible.

Hey, I'm Russ; a US developer based in eastern Colorado.
I've been programming for more than 20 years and have studied a wide variety of languages and computer science topics.
Real-time graphics, web application development, and open sourcery often grab my attention though.
I've worked on client and server side code and have experience with things like:

- Static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo, Nuxt.js, VuePress)
- Content management systems (WordPress, Joomla, custom)
- PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Node.js
- ES6+, Vanilla, jQuery, Vue.js
- Backbone, Express, Rails, Slim
- Bower, Bundler, Gulp, Grunt, NPM, Webpack
- Responsive design (SASS, HTML5, CSS3, BEM)
- DevOps, CI/CD, Containers, Docker, OpenShift, TravisCI
- Linux, Bash, SSH, Git, Github, BitBucket
- SPA, PWA, MVC, OOP, REST, API, Auth
- SQL, noSQL, JSON, XML, CSV

I'm also not afraid of adding more to that list if needed.
Feel free to contact me, I'm open for awesome projects or anything else you might need my skills for.
Checkout my portfolio site: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/ or Github: https://github.com/chpmnrssll for more.

I'd be happy to help with this or anything else you might need my skills for.

Beside programming you'll often find me wrenching on a truck or playing guitar.
Learning to code well requires a lot of patience, a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of time.

I usually prefer not to include any dependencies until I've exhausted every vanilla language solution available.
As a developer knowing how to phrase search queries, review other developers’ code, and apply it to the problem that you’re trying to solve.
A big part of freelancing is estimating how long things will take.
There will always be something that will take a massive amount of time to figure out in a new programming language or framework.
Don’t put yourself in an awkward spot by projecting time for something you don’t already know.
Only agree to freelance work with technologies that you know.

I have experience in everything you're looking for.
I have experience in most of your requirements, and am not afraid of learning more.
I have experience building everything from REST APIs, content management systems, single page apps, and more.
I've built content management systems from scratch (with and without frameworks) in PHP, Node, & Ruby.
I've built everything from content management systems to WordPress plug-ins in the past,

I've worked with a few static site generators like Jekyll, Hexo, Nuxt.js, and VuePress.
They all do similar things from what I've seen (static routes, converts md to html, layouts, templates, themes).
I see a lot of familiar looking folders and .yml files in your repo.

I have some code on Github where I was testing automated build/deployment with Travis-CI and different static site generators.
There's also a Jekyll theme that I modified for another upWork client (updated to font-awesome v5).
