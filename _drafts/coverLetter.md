# Build Instructions

The first paragraph tells the company why you want to work for them. Once you
have written down why you want to work there, back it up with a single specific
reason why.

The second paragraph tells the company why they want to hire you. Highlight the
exact things you want to bring to the company, whether itâ€™s knowledge of some
tech, domain knowledge, a process you follow, or whatever else you think might
work to help solve their problems. And again, back it up with a specific
example.

A great cover letter is an opportunity to explain any shortcomings you might
have. Horribly underqualified but pretty sure you have what it takes? Have a
huge gap in your resume? Really, really want to work for this particular
company? The cover letter is where you do it.

# Past CV

What happened to oDesk? Well, at least I've been carried over to UpWork!  But
that means I'm not a "Rising Talent" and don't have a "Responsiveness" or
"Job Success" scores. Hopefully we can change that because after recovering from
 back surgery and being full-time dad for a while, I am back and ready to code!

I've been programming in some form or another since the mid 90's and have
studied a wide variety of languages and computer science topics. I'm primarily
drawn to the web platform these days and have experience building everything
from REST APIs, content management systems, single page apps, and games.



I might just be the front-end bug hunter you need, but I haven't been active on
UpWork for quite a while. I have a diverse portfolio in my profile and more info
can be found on my personal site: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/
or my GitHub profile: https://github.com/chpmnrssll

Hope to hear from you, but if not;
Thanks for reading,
  Russ


I haven't been active on Upwork for quite a while, but this sounds like an
interesting project to start back up with. I actually came across that link a
while back and read up on pseudo 3D type engines. Here's some other useful code
I found too: https://github.com/1kevinxu1/Sunset-Drive

If you still need help with this, I'm available and have experience with HTML5,
Javascript, & Canvas. I've done some Flash to HTML5 conversions too. More info
about me can be found on my Upwork portfolio, my personal site:
https://chpmnrssll.github.io/ or my GitHub profile: https://github.com/chpmnrssll

Thanks,
  Russ


Hello,
This looks like an interesting product, and I think I could be of help with the
frontend development. I haven't been active on oDesk/upWork for quite a while
due to a spinal fusion surgery and a toddler keeping me running, but am now
ready to get back into it. I'm located in eastern Colorado not far from you, if
that's worth anything.

I can tick all the boxes too:
HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, ES6, Ajax, Rest, APIs
Several client & server frameworks (And the underlying concepts)
Photoshop, Gimp, Inkscape
PHP, Ruby, Node
Git, Github
more...

I've built content management systems from scratch before, with and without MVC
frameworks, with SQL and MongoDB. I'm sure I can help you build some great UI &
components for controlling your CMS. Hope to hear from you!

Thanks,
Russ


## Past Q/A
Do you have experience in developing single-page web apps?
  Yes, single and multi-page apps. My personal dev site has been my playground
  for playing with SPA/PWA. It's built with Jekyll/Ruby, hosted on Github Pages,
   and has tons of newer frontend features.
  https://chpmnrssll.github.io/


Do you have experience working with Docker?
  I've used the RedHat OpenShift PaaS a bit, which is just another layer of
  abstraction on top of Docker containers and Kubernetes for deployment.


What is the hardest technical problem you've personally had to solve and what KPIs did that project affect?
  While not related to any KPI, I have spent the past year learning the in/outs
  of Arch linux and installing it on every piece of hardware that it will run on.
  Arch's "build it yourself" attitude to everything seems like a programmers
  playground, and it has some of the best docs around!


How many years experience do you have with CSS?
  15+, I've been using CSS since tables were used for page layout and flash was
  still cool.


How many years experience do you have with JavaScript?
  Since IE6 or so (early 2000s?). I remember Microsoft JScript nonsense.


Have you created responsive web applications before?
  Yes, my GitHub Pages site is a responsive single page app. It's built with
  Jekyll, Sass, BEM, CSS3, offline caching, animations, and lots of vanilla
  JavaScript.

  https://chpmnrssll.github.io/


Can you show me examples(links) of your best work? Which part of the project did
you directly contribute to? No Word Press or TEMPLATE SITES.
  My current portfolio site is some of my best work. It's a GitHub, Jekyll, Sass,
  BEM, single page, animated, offline, responsive app.
    https://chpmnrssll.github.io/

  Multi-user content management app:
    https://github.com/chpmnrssll/multi-CMS

  PHP MongoDB REST server:
    https://github.com/chpmnrssll/api

  Old PHP SQL content management system:
    https://github.com/chpmnrssll/old/tree/master/php


This project is very large with several custom features. Can you send me
examples of a website with custom software solutions that you like and why?


Are you comfortable working in someone else's code?
  Yes, as long as it's a consistent style; I am proficient with git too.
