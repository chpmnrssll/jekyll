have written down why you want to work there, back it up with a single specific
reason why.

The second paragraph tells the company why they want to hire you. Highlight the
exact things you want to bring to the company, whether itâ€™s knowledge of some
tech, domain knowledge, a process you follow, or whatever else you think
might work to help solve their problems. And again, back it up with a specific example.

A great cover letter is an opportunity to explain any shortcomings you might have.

About
  I'm a developer currently based in Eastern Colorado
  Beside programming you'll often find me wrenching on a truck or playing guitar.
  I've been programming for more than 20 years, starting way back in the day on a 486dx 33mhz PC.
  I specialized early in computer graphics, games, and web application development.
  First in Basic, then C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, and more.

  I have been learning the in/outs of Arch linux by installing it on every piece of hardware that it will run on.
  Arch's "build it yourself" attitude to everything seems like a programmers playground, and it has some of the best docs around!
