Learning to code well requires a lot of patience, a lot of enthusiasm and a lot
of time. As a developer knowing how to phrase search queries, review other
developers’ code, and apply it to the problem that you’re trying to solve.

A big part of freelancing is estimating how long things will take. There will
always be something that will take a massive amount of time to figure out in a
new programming language or framework.

Don’t put yourself in an awkward spot by projecting time for something you don’t
already know. Only agree to freelance work with technologies that you know.
