## Build Instructions

The first paragraph tells the company why you want to work for them. Once you
have written down why you want to work there, back it up with a single specific
reason why.

The second paragraph tells the company why they want to hire you. Highlight the
exact things you want to bring to the company, whether itâ€™s knowledge of some
tech, domain knowledge, a process you follow, or whatever else you think
might work to help solve their problems. And again, back it up with a specific example.

A great cover letter is an opportunity to explain any shortcomings you might have.
Horribly under-qualified but pretty sure you have what it takes? Have a huge gap
in your resume? Really, really want to work for this particular company?
The cover letter is where you do it.

It fought me a little bit, but I usually always win in the end.
I recommend looking into


Yeah, I've seen those recommended content ads. A few questions though:
Do you have the backend setup to test with?
Can I use CSS Grid for layout?
If so, I'm interested and think I can optimize it to a tiny size.

Petteri, I spent some time today putting together a demo and have it temporarily hosted here: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/taboola/
I have the JSON hardcoded for now. The url you gave me keeps giving me "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource." CORS errors, once that's resolved I can update the script to load data from your endpoint. I used CSS grid to get multiple responsive columns. It does go past 3 columns at higher resolutions though. Is that a hard limit for grid sizing? If so, I can keep at it. Let me know if I'm on the right track or if you want to change anything. Thanks

Ok, here's a new version with the changes you requested: https://chpmnrssll.github.io/test/taboola.html
Is this what you had in mind? I added the a "source" key to each entry in the test JSON.
Let me know when you're ready to move forward.

Still getting "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' headers" errors with an AJAX GET/POST request, but JSONP works great.
https://chpmnrssll.github.io/test/taboola.html

Petteri,
I swapped out the JSONP for a POST request, works great now. I didn't know exactly how the original Taboola section looked until I realized that ad-blocker was still active (facepalm). It should look a lot closer now. It's kind of an unusual approach to build & style elements in vanilla JavaScript, but it's tiny (under 3.5k without minifying), and should be very fast to load. There's a breakpoint @600px where I change the scale of the items (larger in a smaller container), then just let the grid flow responsively to fill in from there. It only checks the media query the first time it is rendered, so to see different widths correctly the page must be refreshed. I didn't think it was a big deal as developers are about the only people I see constantly resizing their windows. There's a few variables included to customize logo text, image, endpoint, etc.

I'm going to send the source file rather than screen-shots so you can take a look. Let me know if there's any more I need to take a look at.


Petteri, here's an updated copy with your changes. I limited the grid to 1 row below 550px, 2 rows below 600px, and tweaked the widths some more. It's trial and error getting the grid to do exactly what you want without a normal media query from a stylesheet. It looks ok here, but I've only tested in dev tools w/device toolbar (kinda hard to inject a script from javascript console on a mobile device). I can make more adjustments if you need or find a different way to do the breakpoints if it's not quite what you need.


Nilay, Sorry I went silent for bit, I ended up tearing StreamSaver.js completely apart, refactored it, and built a somewhat working test.
I had trouble getting fetch to do a proper CORS request for your public bucket files on B2. So I ended up putting together the test with Google Drive & gapi (they use range requests too). Looking through the docs I found something about adding CORS rules to your bucket, but it sounds like you need to do this with your account access. It should be simple to swap the B2 api in once the access control issues are fixed.

I'm still working on how to use readable/writable streams to re-assemble the chunks write to single file, but splitting requests into multiple range requests works well. Would it be possible to enable GitHub Pages in the repo settings? Then I could setup a live demo/test page.

## Past Q/A

### Have you created responsive web applications before? Do you have experience in developing single-page web apps?
Yes, my portfolio site is my playground for SPA & PWA experiments.

## About

I'm a developer currently based in Eastern Colorado
Beside programming you'll often find me wrenching on a truck or playing guitar.
I've been programming for more than 20 years, starting way back in the day on a 486dx 33mhz PC.
I specialized early in computer graphics, games, and web application development.
First in Basic, then C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, and more.

I have been learning the in/outs of Arch linux by installing it on every piece of hardware that it will run on.
Arch's "build it yourself" attitude to everything seems like a programmers playground, and it has some of the best docs around!
