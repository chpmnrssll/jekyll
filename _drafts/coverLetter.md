## Build Instructions

The first paragraph tells the company why you want to work for them. Once you
have written down why you want to work there, back it up with a single specific
reason why.

The second paragraph tells the company why they want to hire you. Highlight the
exact things you want to bring to the company, whether it’s knowledge of some
tech, domain knowledge, a process you follow, or whatever else you think might
work to help solve their problems. And again, back it up with a specific example.

A great cover letter is an opportunity to explain any shortcomings you might have.
Horribly under-qualified but pretty sure you have what it takes? Have a huge gap
in your resume? Really, really want to work for this particular company?
The cover letter is where you do it.
