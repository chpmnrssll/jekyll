# Web Development - Laravel - WordPress - JavaScript
 I specialize in databases, API interfaces, custom CMS plugins, and web scrapers. I am a full time freelancer with five years of full stack web development experience. I am a US-based web developer from Lake Guntersville, Alabama in the Huntsville area. My company is called [CyberWorldBuilders.com].

I have a background in PHP programming, MySQL databases and JavaScript. I specialize in MVC frameworks like Laravel and Yii, as well as custom CMS theme and plugin development including WordPress and Craft. I use git version control [github.com/cyberworld-builders] and vagrant virtualization. If you are a fellow developer, scroll to the bottom for a more comprehensive list of tech acronyms.

I build web applications and plugins that make your data work for you!

PUT YOUR SPREADSHEETS IN A DATABASE. Take a messy pile of elaborate spreadsheets and put them into a database that works and a user experience that makes sense.

One of the most common problems I encounter as a professional web developer is when a company has done all they can effectively do with spreadsheets and it’s time to move on to a real database. Spreadsheets are a great way to start organizing your documents in a meaningful way. They are structured and you can program them. They’re easily shared online now, too. However, as companies scale so do the spreadsheets. Eventually you need a relational way to analyze information across multiple documents. This can not only save you time and money but it often helps you better understand your own data by presenting it in flexible and convenient ways.

USE AN API INTERFACE. Build interfaces with other major websites to facilitate an automated and effective flow of data through your system.

Many companies spend a lot of time browsing through client accounts on Google Adwords or Facebook Marketing and manually analyze information and punch it into their system. These days all major well-known websites provide a pretty comprehensive and documented interface with their web service. I have built automated systems that import, analyze and act on any number of conditions across client accounts.

Another common complaint is with lead capture. Just like with spreadsheets, companies will end up with mail lists a mile long with no discernable organization or strategy. I can build lead capture forms that will tag the exact moment in your click funnel where your visitors left your site, so that you can email them personalized messages and links back to continue on their path to a conversion.

HAVE YOUR OWN CUSTOM PLUGIN. Create pluggable and reusable software for features that are needed across your entire site network.

If you have a network of sites, you are well aware that there are common features you want to be able to leverage on every site. But there’s not always a pluggable solution that you can reuse. Often you will find that you have to keep doing the same thing over and over again. This is not only a headache in itself, but it becomes a logistical nightmare when you need to make across the board changes. Whether your system is built around an MVC framework or a CMS like WordPress, I can build a custom package or plugin that can be managed in one repository and pushed out to all your sites at once.

SCRAPE THE WEB. Scrape data from elusive websites to fill your own database with crucial information for you and your members and visitors.

Sometimes the data you want to collect and monitor is not readily available through an actual web service. That’s when you need your own scraping bot to crawl the sites you’re interested in and feed the data back to your website. I have been writing scripts for years and I know how to parse the markup code behind web pages and prepare and insert the data back into your own database to do whatever you want with it.

Here’s a list of tech that I use:

PHP, MySQL, Linux, Nginx, Apache, Ubuntu, Red Hat, EC2, Aurora, Git, Vagrant, Virtualbox, Composer, Bash, SSH.

Amazon Web Service (AWS), Rackspace, Wp-engine, Digital Ocean, Blue Host, Godaddy, many other independently managed cloud hosting services.

jQuery, Bootstrap, SASS, NPM/Node.js, React.js, Gulp, HTML5, CSS3. (Yes, I do front end too.)
