## Introduction
* description, how-to, article
* history, bbs, roguelike, terminal

This article is a how-to for some of those out there old enough to remember the
heyday of BBS'es and MUDs. I was always fascinated by the talent of the folks
good enough to make ASCII art that looked like real images. I decided to create
an algorithm that would convert a real image into its ASCII representation.
There should be some little tidbits of code that you might enjoy, even if you're
not a fan of the early internet.

## Background
downsampled
* types of ASCII art
  - single character, colored from image pixels
  - single character, colored from grayscale/lightness values of pixels
  - multiple characters, calculate character lightness, find matching character for each pixel

There are a few kinds of ASCII art. I've tried to represent at least three of
those styles here in this article. First, we'll do a single character ASCII
drawing, and just set the colors of each character to the same colors as each
pixel in the image. Next, we'll reduce the image to a grayscale drawing, then
output the HTML in varying shades of gray, still using a single ASCII character.
Finally, we'll reduce the image to grayscale, then, based on the shade of gray
for each pixel, output different ASCII characters that have a different "shade".
By shade, I'm simply talking about how dark a character will appear on a white
background. So, for example, "#" appears to be much darker than ":" on a white
background.

You can experiment with changing the character constants in the code to output
different effects. I got particularly interesting results when I reversed the
order of the output characters to get a "negative" effect.

<div id="output"></div>

## Using the code
I've documented the code in the solution, but I will include my favorite method
here for review. This method is the third type of ASCII art (mentioned above).
It will take a posted file (via HTTP), read the pixels in, get the grayscale
value of each pixel, then find the appropriate ASCII character to output.

``` javascript
//% highlight javascript linenos %}
let output = document.getElementById("output"),
    canvas = document.createElement("canvas"),
    ascii = document.createElement("pre");
    ctx = canvas.getContext("2d"),
    image = new Image();

image.src = "/assets/images/skull.png";

image.onload = function() {
  let characters = "#*+`Â´'.:dbPUVA<>Xx ".split(""),
      cell = { width: 8, height: 8 },
      characterLightnessValues = [],
      outputCharacters = [],
      scale = 1.5;

// draw the characters and get lightness value (imageData)
canvas.width = cell.width;
canvas.height = cell.height;
ctx.font = cell.height + "px monospace";

// use characters array from above
/*characters.forEach(function (character) {
  characterLightnessValues[character] = getCharacterLightness(character);
});*/

// use all characters from 32-127
for (let character = 32; character < 127; character++) {
  let string = String.fromCharCode(character);
  characters[string] = string;
  characterLightnessValues[string] = getCharacterLightness(string);
}

//change canvas size & draw image
canvas.width = this.width * scale;
canvas.height = this.height * scale;
ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

// loop through imageData (by cell size)
for (let y = 0; y < canvas.height; y += cell.width) {
  for (let x = 0; x < canvas.width; x += cell.height) {
    let data = ctx.getImageData(x, y, cell.width, cell.height).data;
    //find matching character from imageData block, add to outputCharacters
    outputCharacters.push(getMatchingCharacter(data));
  }
  // end of the line
  let avg = { lightness:0, r:0, g:0, b:0, a:0 };
  outputCharacters.push({ character: "\n", average: avg });
}


// final results
ascii.style.width = "${ canvas.width }px";
ascii.style.height = "${ canvas.height }px";
ascii.style.font = "${ cell.height }px monospace";
ascii.style.letterSpacing = "${ cell.width*0.4 }px";
ascii.style.lineHeight = "${ cell.height*1.1 }px";
outputCharacters.forEach(function (match) {
  let span = document.createElement("span");
  let average = match.average;
  span.innerText = match.character;
  span.style.color = "rgba(${ average.r }, ${ average.g }, ${ average.b }, ${ average.a })";
  span.style.textShadow = "0px 0px 4px ${ span.style.color }";
  ascii.appendChild(span);
});

canvas.width /= 4;
canvas.height /= 4;
canvas.style.float = "right";
ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
output.appendChild(canvas);
output.appendChild(ascii);
};
// % endhighlight %}
```

In a nutshell, we're doing the following:

* Convert the Image object into a Bitmap object
* Enclose the output in HTML paragraph tags
* Loop through each pixel in the bitmap, and obtain the color
* Strip the color information from the pixel (see below)
* Find the character to use based on the new shade (see below)
* Aggregate all of the characters, then return the HTML

## Converting to grayscale
The simplest way to convert a pixel to grayscale is by taking each pixel's Red, Green, and Blue components, dividing the summed value for each by three, and building a new color like so:

```javascript
```

## Converting colors to characters
To do this required some experimenting. The values I've included with the demo code seem to work fairly well, but feel free to experiment with different character sets. In order to convert the gray shade to a character, we really only need one value. I chose to use the new Red value.

```javascript
function getMatchingCharacter(data) {
  let avg = { lightness:0, r:0, g:0, b:0, a:0 },
      pixelCount = data.length / 4;
      min = Infinity,
      best = " ";

  // running average of lightness, & rgba for this imageData block
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
    let lightness = (data[i] + data[i+1] + data[i+2]) / 3;
    avg.lightness += lightness;
    avg.r += data[i];
    avg.g += data[i+1];
    avg.b += data[i+2];
    avg.a += data[i+3];
  }

  avg.lightness /= pixelCount;
  avg.r /= pixelCount;
  avg.g /= pixelCount;
  avg.b /= pixelCount;
  avg.a /= pixelCount;

  avg.lightness = Math.round(avg.lightness)
  avg.r = Math.round(avg.r);
  avg.g = Math.round(avg.g);
  avg.b = Math.round(avg.b);
  avg.a = Math.round(avg.a);

  // find character with lightness that closely matches this imageData block
  characters.forEach(function (character) {
    let difference = Math.abs(avg.lightness - characterLightnessValues[character]);
    if (difference < min) {
      min = difference;
      best = character;
    }
  });

  return { character: best, average: avg };
}
```

You can use as few or as many constants as you like. 9 seemed to provide good results. The constant values that I chose are are as follows:

```javascript
function getCharacterLightness(character) {
  // clear canvas (black)
  ctx.fillStyle = "#000";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, cell.width, cell.height);

  // draw the character (white)
  ctx.fillStyle = "#FFF";
  ctx.fillText(character, 0, cell.height / 2);

  let data = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, cell.width, cell.height).data, avg = 0;

  // running average of lightness for this imageData block
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
    let lightness = (data[i] + data[i+1] + data[i+2]) / 3;
    avg += lightness;
  }

  avg /= (data.length / 4);
  return Math.round(Math.min(avg*8, 255));
}
```

So now, as we get the gray shade for each pixel, we just output the corresponding ASCII character. The logo of my favorite team (Denver Broncos) now appears as follows:

## Points of interest
Many of you will notice that I did not use an HTML Text Writer to build the HTML. Simply put, it was more overhead than I needed. StringBuilder seemed to work very well, and though it doesn't afford me the luxury of ensuring I have the right formatting, it is by far the fastest solution.

Styling is handled by a CSS file (included). For this reason, the "class='ascii_art'" bit was added to the opening paragraph tag. You may notice that the VS2005 IDE flags the "line-spacing" attribute in the CSS designer. Don't worry... both IE and Firefox know how to handle it. Line spacing keeps the characters close so there is not a lot of whitespace between the lines. Also, it is important to use a MONOTYPE font (Lucida Console, Courier New, Terminal, etc.) for the font, otherwise your image will be extremely skewed.

Currently, the solution just performs a Response.Write() of the HTML to the Default.aspx page on postback. This could obviously be modified to post to a separate page, but I chose not to for purposes of simplicity and illustration.

Happy ASCII'ing!
