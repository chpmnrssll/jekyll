## Introduction
* description, how-to, article
* custom elements, canvas, es6

This article is a how-to for some of those out there old enough to remember the
heyday of BBS'es and MUDs. I was always fascinated by the talent of the folks
good enough to make ASCII art that looked like real images. I decided to create
an algorithm that would convert a real image into its ASCII representation.
There should be some little tidbits of code that you might enjoy, even if you're
not a fan of the early internet.

## Background
* history
  * bbs door games
  * roguelike
  * terminal
  * compression
  * downsampling

* generateCharacters
  - populates the character array with { character, average: { lightness, r, g, b, a }} objects

* getCharacterAverage
  - draws a white character on a black background in a small canvas
  - returns this characters' average lightness from getImageDataAverage

* getImageDataAverage
  - returns the average lightness and rgb for imageData

* convertImage
  - iterates over a canvas in cell.width by cell.height blocks calling getMatchingCharacter
  - returns matching characters array for entire image

* getMatchingCharacter
  - returns a character that matches this imageData block lightness

* based on the lightness for each pixel, output ASCII characters that have a matching lightness value
- calculate character lightness, find matching character for each pixel

Lightness is how bright a white character will appear on a black background.
For example, the character "#" appears to be much brighter than ":".

You can experiment with changing the character constants in the code to output
different effects. I got particularly interesting results when I reversed the
order of the output characters to get a "negative" effect.

## Using the code
I've documented the code in the solution, but I will include my favorite method
here for review. This method is the third type of ASCII art (mentioned above).
It will take a posted file (via HTTP), read the pixels in, get the grayscale
value of each pixel, then find the appropriate ASCII character to output.

``` javascript
//% highlight javascript linenos %}
let output = document.getElementById("output"),
    canvas = document.createElement("canvas"),
    ascii = document.createElement("pre");
    ctx = canvas.getContext("2d"),
    image = new Image();

image.src = "/assets/images/skull.png";

image.onload = function() {
  let characters = "#*+`Â´'.:dbPUVA<>Xx ".split(""),
      cell = { width: 8, height: 8 },
      characterLightnessValues = [],
      outputCharacters = [],
      scale = 1.5;

// draw the characters and get lightness value (imageData)
canvas.width = cell.width;
canvas.height = cell.height;
ctx.font = cell.height + "px monospace";

// use characters array from above
/*characters.forEach(function (character) {
  characterLightnessValues[character] = getCharacterLightness(character);
});*/

// use all characters from 32-127
for (let character = 32; character < 127; character++) {
  let string = String.fromCharCode(character);
  characters[string] = string;
  characterLightnessValues[string] = getCharacterLightness(string);
}

//change canvas size & draw image
canvas.width = this.width * scale;
canvas.height = this.height * scale;
ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

// loop through imageData (by cell size)
for (let y = 0; y < canvas.height; y += cell.width) {
  for (let x = 0; x < canvas.width; x += cell.height) {
    let data = ctx.getImageData(x, y, cell.width, cell.height).data;
    //find matching character from imageData block, add to outputCharacters
    outputCharacters.push(getMatchingCharacter(data));
  }
  // end of the line
  let avg = { lightness:0, r:0, g:0, b:0, a:0 };
  outputCharacters.push({ character: "\n", average: avg });
}


// final results
ascii.style.width = "${ canvas.width }px";
ascii.style.height = "${ canvas.height }px";
ascii.style.font = "${ cell.height }px monospace";
ascii.style.letterSpacing = "${ cell.width*0.4 }px";
ascii.style.lineHeight = "${ cell.height*1.1 }px";
outputCharacters.forEach(function (match) {
  let span = document.createElement("span");
  let average = match.average;
  span.innerText = match.character;
  span.style.color = "rgba(${ average.r }, ${ average.g }, ${ average.b }, ${ average.a })";
  span.style.textShadow = "0px 0px 4px ${ span.style.color }";
  ascii.appendChild(span);
});

canvas.width /= 4;
canvas.height /= 4;
canvas.style.float = "right";
ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
output.appendChild(canvas);
output.appendChild(ascii);
};
// % endhighlight %}
```

In a nutshell, we're doing the following:

* Convert the Image object into a Bitmap object
* Enclose the output in HTML paragraph tags
* Loop through each pixel in the bitmap, and obtain the color
* Strip the color information from the pixel (see below)
* Find the character to use based on the new shade (see below)
* Aggregate all of the characters, then return the HTML

## Converting to pixels to lightness values
The simplest way to get a lightness value is by averaging all of the pixels' rgb components.

```javascript
```

## Converting lightness values to characters
In order to convert the lightness value to a character, we average blocks of
pixels cell.width by cell.height and find a character in the array with a matching value.
The values I've included with the demo code seem to work fairly well, but feel free to experiment with different character sets.

```javascript
function getMatchingCharacter(data) {
  let avg = { lightness:0, r:0, g:0, b:0, a:0 },
      pixelCount = data.length / 4;
      min = Infinity,
      best = " ";

  // running average of lightness, & rgba for this imageData block
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
    let lightness = (data[i] + data[i+1] + data[i+2]) / 3;
    avg.lightness += lightness;
    avg.r += data[i];
    avg.g += data[i+1];
    avg.b += data[i+2];
    avg.a += data[i+3];
  }

  avg.lightness /= pixelCount;
  avg.r /= pixelCount;
  avg.g /= pixelCount;
  avg.b /= pixelCount;
  avg.a /= pixelCount;

  avg.lightness = Math.round(avg.lightness)
  avg.r = Math.round(avg.r);
  avg.g = Math.round(avg.g);
  avg.b = Math.round(avg.b);
  avg.a = Math.round(avg.a);

  // find character with lightness that closely matches this imageData block
  characters.forEach(function (character) {
    let difference = Math.abs(avg.lightness - characterLightnessValues[character]);
    if (difference < min) {
      min = difference;
      best = character;
    }
  });

  return { character: best, average: avg };
}
```

You can use as few or as many constants as you like. 9 seemed to provide good results. The constant values that I chose are are as follows:

```javascript
function getCharacterLightness(character) {
  // clear canvas (black)
  ctx.fillStyle = "#000";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, cell.width, cell.height);

  // draw the character (white)
  ctx.fillStyle = "#FFF";
  ctx.fillText(character, 0, cell.height / 2);

  let data = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, cell.width, cell.height).data, avg = 0;

  // running average of lightness for this imageData block
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
    let lightness = (data[i] + data[i+1] + data[i+2]) / 3;
    avg += lightness;
  }

  avg /= (data.length / 4);
  return Math.round(Math.min(avg*8, 255));
}
```

So now, as we get the gray shade for each pixel, we just output the corresponding ASCII character. The logo of my favorite team (Denver Broncos) now appears as follows:

## Points of interest
Many of you will notice that I did not use an HTML Text Writer to build the HTML. Simply put, it was more overhead than I needed. StringBuilder seemed to work very well, and though it doesn't afford me the luxury of ensuring I have the right formatting, it is by far the fastest solution.

Styling is handled by a CSS file (included). For this reason, the "class='ascii_art'" bit was added to the opening paragraph tag. You may notice that the VS2005 IDE flags the "line-spacing" attribute in the CSS designer. Don't worry... both IE and Firefox know how to handle it. Line spacing keeps the characters close so there is not a lot of whitespace between the lines. Also, it is important to use a MONOTYPE font (Lucida Console, Courier New, Terminal, etc.) for the font, otherwise your image will be extremely skewed.

Currently, the solution just performs a Response.Write() of the HTML to the Default.aspx page on postback. This could obviously be modified to post to a separate page, but I chose not to for purposes of simplicity and illustration.

Happy ASCII'ing!
