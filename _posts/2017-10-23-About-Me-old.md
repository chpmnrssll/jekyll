### Intro
I have always known that I wanted to be a programmer from the time I was young. While all the other kids were just playing games, I was trying to figure out how they worked so I could make my own. I remember sitting awake playing with my friends old TI/99, the big basic programming manuals, saving and loading from tapes, programming virtual robots, and dying of dysentery. I'd collect every magazine related to video and computer games that was available then beg for the latest and best game console so I could see them all. I finally got what I considered a normal computer (a Macintosh Classic) and I started playing with Hypercard since I heard about the game Myst using it. When the user friendly Mac interface got too boring for me I moved into the pc world and found DOS to be the best thing I'd ever seen. There was a used bookstore that I used to get shareware discs from (5 1/4" floppies), programming manuals (K&R Ansi C Book), and lists of all the local BBS's. I remember being so happy with my first compiled executable files even if they were just simple text based multiple choice programs like the door games I'd seen dialing BBS's.

The next upgrade brought about windows, dial up internet, ftp, and the first versions of web browsers. That opened up a whole lot of options for me. I'd download programming tutorials, coding demos, tracked music (mod/s3m/xm), and any other type of tech information I could find. Playing all these VGA games and seeing the coding demos just made me wanna know more, so I dug deeper in and started playing with 80x86 assembly language and doing my own graphic demos.
