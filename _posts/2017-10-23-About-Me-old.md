### Intro
I knew that I wanted to be a programmer from the time I was young. While all the other kids were just playing games, I was trying to figure out how they worked so I could make my own. I remember staying awake late playing with my friends old Texas Instruments TI99, Basic programming manuals, and saving/loading from tapes. I'd collect every magazine related to computer and video games that was available so I could see it all. When I finally got a Macintosh Classic, I was amazed by the GUI. I started playing with Hypercard when I heard about the game Myst using it.

Then I moved into the PC world and found DOS. There was a used bookstore that I used to get shareware discs from (5 1/4" floppies), programming manuals (K&R Ansi C), and lists of all the local BBS's. I remember being so happy with my first compiled executable files even if they were just ASCii based multiple choice games.

The next upgrade brought about Windows, dial up internet, ftp, and the first web browsers. That opened up a whole lot of options for me. I'd download programming tutorials, coding demos, tracker music (mod/s3m/xm), and any other type of tech information I could find. Playing all these VGA games and seeing the coding demos just made me wanna know more, so I dug deeper in and started playing with 80x86 assembly language and doing my own graphic demos.
I have always had a deep interest in many fields of Computer Science and continue studying to satisfy my curiosity.
